completed:

upcoming interview added

calendar doesnt let you increment/decrement days

Gray out buttons that we already have an interview in

Passing the interview date doesnt update the main UI

We need to add text showing passed interviews

basic animation when applying to job

We need to forward time when undergoing an interview

Switch to calculating application results at end of day

We need an event scroll

refactor ApplicationTracker, move complexity to Systems that rely on it

Delete RejectionsTextView.cs, InterviewTextView.cs and OngoingTextView.cs and just have ResumeSubmissionsTextView.cs, have that display ongoing, pass, fail etc... 

All textViews should display ongoing, passed, and failed.

todo:

Generate text on the event scroll at the end of each day

Interviews are no longer triggered anymore.

We need to disable buttons when animation is playing

We need to figure out a fun minigame for the actual interviews

Lastly when we win we need a flow chart showing how many applications etc...
